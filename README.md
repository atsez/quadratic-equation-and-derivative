# quadratic equation and derivative
 
 This programs asks for the required information for the quadratic equation and gives you the value of constant. It also tells you if the delta is equal, less or bigger than 0. Then, the program calculates H and K to graph the equation with matplotlib.The code also graphs the tangent of the paarabola (derivetive) and gives the desired value to you.
